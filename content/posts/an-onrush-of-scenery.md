# An Onrush of Scenery

I read "The Bell Jar" last year, and am now reading "Red Comet: The Short Life and Blazing Art of Sylvia Plath." Part One of the book is dedicated to Plath's young years through college graduation- at which point she was very much a practicing poet, looking for life experiences that would feed her writing. The whole world waiting is for her.

It's in this mindset I start a new role, Technology Relations, at a company not at all geared towards the traditional Developer Relations or Evangelist role. My company does not serve a global open source community for one piece of software. We're a consulting firm, rooted in accounting more than anything else. And yet, the framework of community building and user experience will be apt to move the company towards its stated goals. Information management and sharing at such a large company always has room to improve. This role, for me personally and for the company willing to trust me with it, is an opportunity to experiment, to think boldly, to fail sometimes, and to learn together.

I'm in the business of helping folks feel fulfilled at work, like they have resources, more to learn, a purpose. I want people in the commuities I serve to feel like they are able and prepared to face everyday tasks as well as complications, both technolgical and interpersonal. I want to contribute to technology that is slowly and iteratively developed, and considerate of its data sources and its impacts. It's the "boring" approach- but I can't go about it any other way knowing what harmful tech is out there, and what fantastic research is being done to counteract and prevent negative impacts.

Here I'll document my experiments, thoughts, failures, and, hopefully, sucesses as I navigate a new role.
